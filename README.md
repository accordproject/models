This repository hosts all Accord Project models. Models are captured using the [Concerto](https://docs.accordproject.org/docs/model-concerto.html) modeling language; a platform and runtime neutral typed schema language.

The build system for this repository publishes the models to: https://models.accordproject.org

Environment Variables used by the build system:

- `SERVER_ROOT` : the root URL for the server. Used when generating absolute hyperlinks.
- `FORCE_PUBLISH` : disabled the download of external models and model validation. Should be used with care!
